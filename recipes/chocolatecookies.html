    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I modified <strong>Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal cookies</strong> very slightly. I came up with 
        something that my boyfriend went CRAZY over! I've never seen him enjoy cookies 
        to that extent! <em>He said I blew his mother's recipe away.</em>

    <h3>How to do: step by step</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until 
            smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Combine the flour, 
            baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until just blended. Mix 
            in the quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop by heaping spoonfuls onto 
            ungreased baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet 
            for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
